Feel getting pretty large/complex yaml files when deploying decent size infrastructure.<p>How do people feel just using AWS <em>SDK</em> or other cloud <em>SDK</em> to write your own deployment tools? Since it is pure code, it is easy to refactor and test.<p>I did some prototype building DataPunch project (https://github.com/datapunchorg/punch) to deploy Data Infrastructure using AWS Go <em>SDK</em>. It provides one click command like “punch install SparkOnEKS” which will automatically deploy a ready-to-use Apache Spark environment on AWS.<p>Want to seek feedbacks and see whether other people have similar ideas?<p>Thanks,\nBo",

I&#x27;ve been working as a &#x27;software engineer&#x27; off and on for 10 years simply out of corporate need (didn&#x27;t go to school for). I had an idea for a personal note taking app and now I&#x27;m considering the possibility of releasing it. In my search for testers, Hacker News came up many times and I thought this may be a good place to post and request some testing and evaluation. As the site rules indicate, I&#x27;m looking for honest, respectful, helpful input.<p>ABOUT THE APP<p>The app is called ResearchDB, a &quot;documenting&quot; form of note taking app - meaning it requires you to &quot;document&quot; your source and has a 1&#x2F;2 dozen required fields. In other words, the purpose of this note taking app is not just noting something of interest, but &quot;supportively documenting&quot; the note and source. This is why I call it ResearchDB. We all have particular, beliefs, ideas, interests, and this note taking app is intended to be a way to document those beliefs, interests and ideas through the creation of multiple &quot;subject-based&quot; databases containing notes in a way that helps us remember and recall those things in a way that helps us remember them. And since it is a phone app, we can recall and pull up those supportive notes at any moment with our handy smartphone.<p>THE APK TARGET COMPATABITY<p>The Minimum SDK is 28 and the target is 30\nIt requires Internet and Storage (read&#x2F;write) permissions so that you have the ability to document sources and can export or import notes and databases on topics of interests.<p>ABOUT THE LINKS<p>I have included a link to the Android APK for downloading and a YouTube link which demonstrates the intent and how to use the app in 9-10 minutes. The APK link takes you to &quot;ufile.io&quot; - a web storage source I use, but it is free to download, there is not a requirement to sign up, create an account or purchase, simply just choose the slower - free download option. The APK should be signed and I will assume a tester may know how to sideload it through developer options to their Android phone.<p>APK\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ufile.io&#x2F;kw5gonpc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ufile.io&#x2F;kw5gonpc</a><p>YouTube\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OvpgviLECXA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OvpgviLECXA</a><p>BTW, the app also includes a PDF pictorial guide on how to do everything - besides the YouTube video.<p>I wasn&#x27;t sure whether or not I should include one of these links above and which would be a more appropriate choice if so.

It started as a project to help me learn Python and Flask, but now has grown into a pretty big project.<p>Some main differences between FlyURL and other self-hosted URL shorteners (like Pckd[0] or Shlink[1]):<p>- FlyURL is ONLY compatible with SQLite (Unlike Pckd)<p>- FlyURL has NO API or CLI (Unlike Shlink)<p>- FlyURL has really basic tracking (Only by clicks), while Pckd and Shlink features more robust tracking (This is something on working)<p>- FlyURL has a clean and basic UI (Influenced by is.gd[2], and thanks to Lit[3])\n- FlyURL requires NO logins (Influenced by chilp.it[6])<p>- FlyURL uses blacklist from Steven Black&#x27;s hosts[4] and its in-house URL shortener service list[5] to block harmful websites and prevent creating a &quot;chain&quot; of URLs (Influenced by is.gd) (I&#x27;m not sure if Pckd or Shlink do the same, but it&#x27;s likely they do)<p>- FlyURL is built with Python and Flask (Shlink is built with PHP, and Pckd is built with React)<p>If you want a URL shortener that just works, then FlyURL may fit for you. If you want more features and more robust, then Shlink and Pckd are better choices.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PckdHQ&#x2F;Pckd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PckdHQ&#x2F;Pckd</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shlink.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shlink.io&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;is.gd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;is.gd</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ajusa.github.io&#x2F;lit&#x2F;docs&#x2F;lit.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ajusa.github.io&#x2F;lit&#x2F;docs&#x2F;lit.html</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;StevenBlack&#x2F;hosts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;StevenBlack&#x2F;hosts</a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;HoangTuan110&#x2F;e6eb412ed32657c841fcc2c12c156f9d\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;HoangTuan110&#x2F;e6eb412ed32657c841fcc2c...</a><p>[6]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chilp.it\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chilp.it</a>",

It started as a project to help me learn Python and Flask, but now has grown into a pretty big project.<p>Some main differences between FlyURL and other self-hosted URL shorteners (like Pckd[0] or Shlink[1]):<p>- FlyURL is ONLY compatible with SQLite (Unlike Pckd)<p>- FlyURL has NO API or <em>CLI</em> (Unlike Shlink)<p>- FlyURL has really basic tracking (Only by clicks), while Pckd and Shlink features more robust tracking (This is something on working)<p>- FlyURL has a clean and basic UI (Influenced by is.gd[2], and thanks to Lit[3])\n- FlyURL requires NO logins (Influenced by chilp.it[6])<p>- FlyURL uses blacklist from Steven Black's hosts[4] and its in-house URL shortener service list[5] to block harmful websites and prevent creating a &quot;chain&quot; of URLs (Influenced by is.gd) (I'm not sure if Pckd or Shlink do the same, but it's likely they do)<p>- FlyURL is built with Python and Flask (Shlink is built with PHP, and Pckd is built with React)<p>If you want a URL shortener that just works, then FlyURL may fit for you. If you want more features and more robust, then Shlink and Pckd are better choices.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https://github.com/PckdHQ/Pckd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/PckdHQ/Pckd</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https://shlink.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://shlink.io/</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://is.gd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://is.gd</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https://ajusa.github.io/lit/docs/lit.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ajusa.github.io/lit/docs/lit.html</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts</a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/HoangTuan110/e6eb412ed32657c841fcc2c12c156f9d\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gist.github.com/HoangTuan110/e6eb412ed32657c841fcc2c...</a><p>[6]: <a href=\"https://chilp.it\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://chilp.it</a>",

But how can we prevent a production issue from recurring, or, how about a bigger challenge — how can you prevent the next one from the get-go?<p>In our case, we tried sending emails to our devs, writing Wikis, and hosting meetups and live sessions to educate our developers, but I felt that it just wasn’t driving the message home. How can developers be expected to remember to configure a liveness probe or to put a memory limit in place for their Kubernetes workload when there are so many things that a dev must remember? Infra just isn’t their primary focus.<p>Today, organizations want to delegate infra-as-code responsibilities to developers, but face a dilemma — even a small misconfiguration can cause major production issues. Some companies lock up infra changes and require ops teams to review all changes, which frustrates both sides. \nDevelopers want to ship features without waiting for infra. And infra teams don&#x27;t want to “babysit” developers by reviewing config files all day long, essentially acting as human debuggers for misconfigurations.<p>That’s why I teamed up with Eyar to found Datree. Our mission is to help engineering teams prevent Kubernetes misconfigurations from reaching production. We believe that providing guardrails to developers protects their infra changes and frees up DevOps teams to focus on what matters most.<p>Datree provides a CLI tool (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;datreeio&#x2F;datree\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;datreeio&#x2F;datree</a>) that runs automated policy checks against your Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts, identifies any misconfigurations within, and suggests how to fix them. The tool comes with dozens of preset, best-practice rules covering the most common mistakes that could affect your production. In addition, you can write custom rules for your policy.<p>Our built-in rules are based on hundreds of Kubernetes post-mortems to ensure the prevention of issues such as resource limits&#x2F;requests (MEM&#x2F;CPU), liveness and readiness probes, labels on resources, Kubernetes schema validation, API version deprecation, and more.<p>Datree comes with a centralized policy dashboard enabling the infra team to dynamically configure rules that run on dev computers during the development phase, as well as within the CI&#x2F;CD process. This central control point propagates policy checks automatically to all developers&#x2F;machines in your company.<p>We initially launched Datree as a general purpose policy engine (see our YC Launch <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22536228\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22536228</a>) in which you could configure all sorts of rules, but the market drove our focus toward infrastructure-as-code and, more specifically, Kubernetes, one of the most painful points of friction between developers and infrastructure teams.<p>When we adjusted to a Kubernetes-focused product, we pivoted our top-down sales-driven model to a bottom-up adoption-driven model focused on the user.<p>Our new dev tool is self-served and open-source. Hundreds of companies are using it to prevent Kubernetes misconfigurations and, in turn, are helping the tool improve by opening issues and submitting pull requests on GitHub.  Our product is well suited for self-evaluation and immediate value delivery. No demo calls — just 2 quick steps to try the product yourself!<p>TechWorld with Nana did a deep technical review of our product, which can be viewed at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hgUfH9Ab258\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hgUfH9Ab258</a>.<p>We look forward to hearing your feedback and answering any questions you may have.

However, Webman is built to be able to install on Windows too as a first-class citizen. It installs release binaries rather than building from source, which keeps package recipes lightweight &amp; lets us require no dependencies. Webman also makes it super easy to install and switch between different versions of software (similar to tools like nvm). I’ve been using it to manage different versions of Go, and it’s worked nicely!<p>If you find any packages you’d like that aren’t in the webman-pkgs repo yet, I’d love to help you out merging a PR! With the new schema support, it’s never been easier to write a package recipe, and CI will make sure your package installs correctly on each supported platform.<p>If you find the project interesting, give it a star! It means a lot :)<p>FYI: Webman is under active development so breaking changes may still occur. Don’t rely on this webman in production at least until a major release.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;candrewlee14&#x2F;webman",

However, Webman is built to be able to install on Windows too as a first-class citizen. It installs release binaries rather than building from source, which keeps package recipes lightweight &amp; lets us require no dependencies. Webman also makes it super easy to install and switch between different versions of software (similar to tools like nvm). I’ve been using it to manage different versions of Go, and it’s worked nicely!<p>If you find any packages you’d like that aren’t in the webman-pkgs repo yet, I’d love to help you out merging a PR! With the new schema support, it’s never been easier to write a package recipe, and CI will make sure your package installs correctly on each supported platform.<p>If you find the project interesting, give it a star! It means a lot :)<p>FYI: Webman is under active development so breaking changes may still occur. Don’t rely on this webman in production at least until a major release.<p>https://github.com/candrewlee14/webman",

We wanted to build something with e-paper given its low-power nature and beautiful, high contrast display which complements your environment and is easy on the eye. Thus, we started working on something to be developed along the lines of Arduino, Raspberry Pi’s open-source ecosystem.<p>paperd.ink has a 4.2” e-paper display comes mounted on the PCB which we have designed to be a general-purpose development board suitable for your projects and applications. You can sync calendars, set up your home IoT dashboard, get to-do lists, and notifications, display art, etc. We have used an ESP32-based microcontroller with WiFi, Bluetooth, and microUSB connectivity. The board can be programmed in Arduino IDE, micropython, or ESP-IDF, you can check out the documentation at docs.paperd.ink. paperd.ink is designed to be low power so you can charge the battery once and go on for months on it depending on the refresh rate. It’s suitable to display low to medium latency or static information. Every paperd.ink comes with a hand-polished, 3D-printed external enclosure.<p>The first paperd.ink prototype was first posted on Show HN (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22340398\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22340398</a>) and other related communities (Reddit, Hackaday, etc)  a little more than 2 years ago. We had a landing page, a short video of the prototype, and a user survey form asking a couple of questions along with a “Would you like to be a part of the waitlist?” question in the end. We got quite an interest from everyone on it so we decided to move ahead.<p>After receiving a positive response to the prototype, the next step was to figure out how to actually bring the product to the real world. We had no upfront capital required for manufacturing so we decided to do a crowdfunding campaign (finding a platform supporting our country India was another issue). At the same time, the pandemic happened which delayed everything because of unfeasible component prices, supply chain issues, and lockdowns everywhere. After researching thoroughly and formulating a production plan and figuring out unit economics, we launched the crowdfunding campaign roughly last year and had the 2nd Show HN post (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27331311\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27331311</a>). In the course of promoting the campaign, we got in contact with FOSS United which is a non-profit foundation that aims at promoting and strengthening the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ecosystem in India. FOSS United offered us a grant and that’s how we survived despite failing to achieve our crowdfunding target goal (we had ~40%).<p>After accepting the grant, we tweaked the PCB a bit and redesigned the external enclosure to make it ready for production. Scouted for manufacturers, suppliers, and shipping agents. Samples were ordered and tested. Test criteria and SOPs were exchanged. Vacuum casting (or any other method of manufacturing) of the enclosures was out of the question given the high NRE cost and high quantity needed to be manufactured, so we 3D printed them. Finally, the first batch was ready in the inventory to be shipped. All the orders received until now have been shipped and users should start receiving them shortly. Thanks to the HN community and our early supporters for everything. And special thanks to Daniel (moderator) for helping with the post. We plan to get feedback on the first batch and then decide on how to move forward. Please feel free to ask any questions!",

                            "value": "paperd.ink (<a href=\"https://paperd.ink\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://paperd.ink</a>) is an open-source e-paper development board. We wanted to build something with e-paper given its low-power nature and beautiful, high contrast display which complements your environment and is easy on the eye. Thus, we started working on something to be developed along the lines of Arduino, Raspberry Pi’s open-source ecosystem.<p>paperd.ink has a 4.2” e-paper display comes mounted on the PCB which we have designed to be a general-purpose development board suitable for your projects and applications. You can sync calendars, set up your home IoT dashboard, get to-do lists, and notifications, display art, etc. We have used an ESP32-based microcontroller with WiFi, Bluetooth, and microUSB connectivity. The board can be programmed in Arduino <em>IDE</em>, micropython, or ESP-IDF, you can check out the documentation at docs.paperd.ink. paperd.ink is designed to be low power so you can charge the battery once and go on for months on it depending on the refresh rate. It’s suitable to display low to medium latency or static information. Every paperd.ink comes with a hand-polished, 3D-printed external enclosure.<p>The first paperd.ink prototype was first posted on Show HN (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22340398\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22340398</a>) and other related communities (Reddit, Hackaday, etc)  a little more than 2 years ago. We had a landing page, a short video of the prototype, and a user survey form asking a couple of questions along with a “Would you like to be a part of the waitlist?” question in the end. We got quite an interest from everyone on it so we decided to move ahead.<p>After receiving a positive response to the prototype, the next step was to figure out how to actually bring the product to the real world. We had no upfront capital required for manufacturing so we decided to do a crowdfunding campaign (finding a platform supporting our country India was another issue). At the same time, the pandemic happened which delayed everything because of unfeasible component prices, supply chain issues, and lockdowns everywhere. After researching thoroughly and formulating a production plan and figuring out unit economics, we launched the crowdfunding campaign roughly last year and had the 2nd Show HN post (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27331311\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27331311</a>). In the course of promoting the campaign, we got in contact with FOSS United which is a non-profit foundation that aims at promoting and strengthening the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ecosystem in India. FOSS United offered us a grant and that’s how we survived despite failing to achieve our crowdfunding target goal (we had ~40%).<p>After accepting the grant, we tweaked the PCB a bit and redesigned the external enclosure to make it ready for production. Scouted for manufacturers, suppliers, and shipping agents. Samples were ordered and tested. Test criteria and SOPs were exchanged. Vacuum casting (or any other method of manufacturing) of the enclosures was out of the question given the high NRE cost and high quantity needed to be manufactured, so we 3D printed them. Finally, the first batch was ready in the inventory to be shipped. All the orders received until now have been shipped and users should start receiving them shortly. Thanks to the HN community and our early supporters for everything. And special thanks to Daniel (moderator) for helping with the post. We plan to get feedback on the first batch and then decide on how to move forward. Please feel free to ask any questions!",

To my surprise, I just can't see the colors of the syntax highlighting. I manage to guess they are there, but I don't actually see them as clearly as the Monokai theme.<p>I'm not colorblind (but my father is), so I don't really understand why.<p>Do you have the same experience?<p>[0] - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVDbu8lhqAA (french)",

Maybe there was a let's do it all in javascript phase, but that doesn't seem to be the answer today.<p>So... modern starter pack? <em>VS Code</em> and Python? Tell him to learn Pandas/SciPy/NumPy?<p>Are there any highly recommended online courses for learning this stuff?",

Firefox add-ons (extensions) are also great, but often extensions ask for an uncomfortable amount of permissions. For example, price comparison extensions want to run on all websites.<p>I want to use multi-account containers to be more selective about which extensions are active. For example, I would like to restrict my price comparison extensions to a &quot;Shopping&quot; container.<p>Is this possible? If not, is there some other mechanism to accomplish this?<p>I already use multiple browsers for another layer of isolation, so I'm most interested in solutions that work within Firefox.<p>[0] https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers<p>[1] https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/",

The idea is to create a single place to explore, discover and consume public APIs as higher level building blocks.<p>Most of the time I don’t use all the features of an API and I assume most devs don&#x27;t either, so picking and choosing the common patterns, abstracting it away and surfacing a new building block is useful. For example, Twilio has a lot of APIs but I only care about SMS. Even then I just want a quick way to send it. So stripping it all away results in something that&#x27;s one endpoint and 3 fields (from, to and message).<p>Another example is something like email. There are services like sendgrid that provide a really feature rich experience for email but I’m just looking for something simple that will let me send plain text or html.<p>There are a number of API marketplaces out there, but we’re doing something different—our goal is to improve productivity. For example, RapidAPI has thousands of APIs, but there’s a lot of duplication. It’s overwhelming for developers. Choice is the enemy of productivity. AWS, on the other hand, offers a curated catalog of services where each focuses on a specific problem. We feel the same: from an API perspective you only need one of each building block. You only need one SMS, Email or Geocoding service.<p>I&#x27;ve been obsessed with this problem since working as an SRE at Google in 2011, seeing how the internal platform and APIs were being used by teams. I then worked at a ride hailing startup called Hailo where we got to build something similar, and experience the velocity of development in shipping products on top of simple, easily discovered APIs. I spent the next few years bootstrapping an open source project called Micro, trying to get people to standardize their API development to reach this goal.<p>Ultimately it took raising funding to take a real shot at it. After seeing the productivity Google unlocked and what Hailo could have done with their platform, it was clear to me it could and should be a product: a single way to consume APIs with one platform, one account and one framework.<p>Our goal is to build an API catalog that can act as the building blocks for most use cases, and then double down on services that have a lot of demand so we can improve the features and reliability.<p>In the wild, every API looks different, the docs are different, you have to figure out if there&#x27;s client libraries or not. We unify all that, so everything looks and feels the same. All our docs are generated based on OpenAPI specs, and we code generate examples&#x2F;client libraries for JS, Go, Dart and the CLI. It means you only ever need one client to access all these APIs.<p>Unifying API development and consumption requires a lot of resources to do at scale, hence it&#x27;s only happening inside fast growing startups and large tech cos. There are a lot of barriers to entry. Getting started isn&#x27;t easy. Our approach has been to first nail API development for ourselves and then focus on API consumption by end users— ultimately we want to let anyone offer APIs on our platform. That requires enough large scale distribution and inbound traffic to make an attractive proposition to developers.<p>We&#x27;ve spent a year building the product with a lot of feedback on what worked and what didn&#x27;t. We’ve signed up 8000 people, served 5M API requests and have 60+ APIs on the platform.<p>On billing: we&#x27;re still figuring it out and would like feedback. It started as a free product, then moved into per request pricing. Unfortunately that&#x27;s hard to scale without a lot of volume and it felt like people were more used to subscriptions for SaaS products so that&#x27;s the route we&#x27;ve gone.<p>Anyway that&#x27;s us, hope you try it out (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m3o.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m3o.com</a>), and would love to hear your thoughts in the comments!",

Our approach has been to first nail API development for ourselves and then focus on API consumption by end users— ultimately we want to let anyone offer APIs on our platform. That requires enough large scale distribution and inbound traffic to make an attractive proposition to developers.<p>We've spent a year building the product with a lot of feedback on what worked and what didn't. We’ve signed up 8000 people, served 5M API requests and have 60+ APIs on the platform.<p>On billing: we're still figuring it out and would like feedback. It started as a free product, then moved into per request pricing. Unfortunately that's hard to scale without a lot of volume and it felt like people were more used to subscriptions for SaaS products so that's the route we've gone.<p>Anyway that's us, hope you try it out (<a href=\"https://m3o.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://m3o.com</a>), and would love to hear your thoughts in the comments!",

MLEM saves all model metadata to a human-readable text file: Python environment, model methods, model input &amp; output data schema and more.<p>3. MLEM helps you turn your Git repository into a Model Registry with features like ML model lifecycle management.<p>Our philosophy is that MLOps tools should be built using the Unix approach - each tool solves a single problem, but solves it very well.

The machine may refuse to serve your request, but it will stay running, and that&#x27;s the important part.<p>This is a follow-up to something I posted three weeks ago.  Ye old web server running the mTCP HTTP server on DOS has now passed 500 hours of runtime and it is still going, at least until the power glitches.  The stats so far:<p>Run-time: 505 hours\nTCP&#x2F;IP connections: 34230\nObjects served: 38865\nTCP Packets sent&#x2F;received: 996627, 889798\nAll packet types sent&#x2F;received: 1544807, 1671011<p>I started running it as a long term test of my TCP&#x2F;IP stack for DOS.  I need to eventually pull the logs from the machine to look for anomalies, but the code is certainly stable.  (I&#x27;m logging to both disk and over UDP so I can snoop in on the machine activity without having a monitor turned on.) \n While the machine is running I&#x27;m taking time to update the documentation.<p>The site is at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brutmanlabs.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brutmanlabs.org&#x2F;</a> .  I did not cache any files in memory, so please be patient with the initial page load.  The current server stats can be seen at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brutmanlabs.org&#x2F;status\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brutmanlabs.org&#x2F;status</a> .<p>Fun fact: you can &quot;hear&quot; vulnerability scans being run against the machine.  The machine beeps for each response served, and vulnerability scans generate 404s which are really quick to serve.  So a sequence of fast beeps is generally a vulnerability scan.",

The machine may refuse to serve your request, but it will stay running, and that's the important part.<p>This is a follow-up to something I posted three weeks ago.  Ye old web server running the mTCP HTTP server on DOS has now passed 500 hours of runtime and it is still going, at least until the power glitches.  The stats so far:<p>Run-time: 505 hours\nTCP/IP connections: 34230\nObjects served: 38865\nTCP Packets sent/received: 996627, 889798\nAll packet types sent/received: 1544807, 1671011<p>I started running it as a long term test of my TCP/IP stack for DOS.  I need to eventually pull the logs from the machine to look for anomalies, but the code is certainly stable.  (I'm logging to both disk and over UDP so I can snoop in on the machine activity without having a monitor turned on.) \n While the machine is running I'm taking time to update the <em>documentation</em>.<p>The site is at <a href=\"http://brutmanlabs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://brutmanlabs.org/</a> .  I did not cache any files in memory, so please be patient with the initial page load.  The current server stats can be seen at <a href=\"http://brutmanlabs.org/status\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://brutmanlabs.org/status</a> .<p>Fun fact: you can &quot;hear&quot; vulnerability scans being run against the machine.  The machine beeps for each response served, and vulnerability scans generate 404s which are really quick to serve.  So a sequence of fast beeps is generally a vulnerability scan.",

Unfortunately, I find that there is always a lot to code before I get to the interesting stuff. So, like every other half-decent programmer, I’ve always tried to automate as much as possible and build reusable libraries by adding levels of indirection and parameters.<p>I’ve been doing this for so long now that my code has become ‘hyper’ parameterised, so much so that I had to store all the parameters in configuration files. These evolved into complete models which are basically a mix between ER models and UML diagrams: they include Entities and Attributes but also support all UML relationships (plus Back References) as well as formulas in object notation like “Product.Name” and “Sum(OrderLines.Amount)”. I’ve even extended the idea to include workflow models to specify what happens when an object is created, updated or deleted or when a pre-requisite condition becomes true.<p>To simplify managing the models, I’ve written a graphical editor, starting with Eclipse GEF but since I like to reinvent the wheel, I moved to plain HTML5&#x2F;JS. To make it even easier, I’ve added Google Speech Recognition so I can now design models by just talking to Chrome and when I’m done, I can deploy them with one click or by saying something like ‘please deploy the application’. This will create a schema for the data and the ‘meta’ application will be ready to offer standard, web based, data management screens.<p>At this stage you’re probably thinking “Great, you can design and deploy data driven apps with your voice, so what?”<p>Ok, let’s move on to something more interesting then, which is what the ‘meta’ app can do because it has access to all the information in the model at run time, like for example, the ability to manipulate the data using natural language queries.<p>This works because having access to the semantics in the model removes the current gap between Machine Learning based Natural Language Understanding systems, which are very flexible but mostly ignorant of the domain model and, on the other hand, old fashioned back end systems with very rigid APIs. You can find a more detailed discussion here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modeling-languages.com&#x2F;modelrunner-open-source-no-code-nlu-voice-modeling-data-platform&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modeling-languages.com&#x2F;modelrunner-open-source-no-co...</a>.<p>So I’ve also added Google Speech Recognition to the ‘meta’ application and I can now just speak to it and tell it to “create a city called Melbourne and set postcode to 3000 and set notes to the most liveable city in the world” or “get me a list of customers living in Sydney aged 40” which I think is pretty cool and almost justifies all the hours and late nights I’ve spent coding it!<p>I think this has pretty obvious applications like for example, being able to manage your data on the go by just talking to your phone instead of trying to use a GUI on a small screen.<p>So, I highly recommend the parameterised indirection approach but if you don’t have a lot of time to write your own code, you might want to have a look at mine, it’s all Open Source with an MIT license: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;etiennesillon&#x2F;ModelRunner\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;etiennesillon&#x2F;ModelRunner</a>.<p>Or, if you just want to try it or watch a demo, just head to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modelrunner.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modelrunner.org</a>.<p>Now, it’s still very much a work in progress and I’ve spent more time on the core engine than on the UI so if you try to break it, you probably will! But, if you give it a try, please let me know how you went!<p>Thank you!",

This will create a schema for the data and the ‘meta’ application will be ready to offer standard, web based, data management screens.<p>At this stage you’re probably thinking “Great, you can design and deploy data driven apps with your voice, so what?”<p>Ok, let’s move on to something more interesting then, which is what the ‘meta’ app can do because it has access to all the information in the model at run time, like for example, the ability to manipulate the data using natural language queries.<p>This works because having access to the semantics in the model removes the current gap between Machine Learning based Natural Language Understanding systems, which are very flexible but mostly ignorant of the domain model and, on the other hand, old fashioned back end systems with very rigid APIs. You can find a more detailed discussion here: <a href=\"https://modeling-languages.com/modelrunner-open-source-no-code-nlu-voice-modeling-data-platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://modeling-languages.com/modelrunner-open-source-no-co...</a>.<p>So I’ve also added Google Speech Recognition to the ‘meta’ application and I can now just speak to it and tell it to “create a city called Melbourne and set postcode to 3000 and set notes to the most liveable city in the world” or “get me a list of customers living in Sydney aged 40” which I think is pretty cool and almost justifies all the hours and late nights I’ve spent coding it!<p>I think this has pretty obvious applications like for example, being able to manage your data on the go by just talking to your phone instead of trying to use a GUI on a small screen.<p>So, I highly recommend the parameterised indirection approach but if you don’t have a lot of time to write your own code, you might want to have a look at mine, it’s all Open Source with an MIT license: <a href=\"https://github.com/etiennesillon/ModelRunner\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/etiennesillon/ModelRunner</a>.<p>Or, if you just want to try it or watch a demo, just head to <a href=\"https://modelrunner.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://modelrunner.org</a>.<p>Now, it’s still very much a work in progress and I’ve spent more time on the core engine than on the UI so if you try to break it, you probably will! But, if you give it a try, please let me know how you went!<p>Thank you!",
