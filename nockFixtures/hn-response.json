                    "story_text": "Dear HN Community. We&#x27;re Bjorn, Dustin, Stefan &amp; Jens, the founders of WunderGraph.<p>More than two years ago, Jens started WunderGraph as a Side Project.\nThe initial idea was to solve the problem of integrating multiple disparate DataSources into a single, unified API Layer.\nWhile solving this problem, Jens realized that his mental model of APIs was wrong.\nMost API tools treat APIs as abstract things or just endpoints, in a very imperative way.\nAt some point, he realized that there&#x27;s a better model to think about APIs:\nAPIs are dependencies and we should treat them in a declarative way!<p>And that&#x27;s how the idea of the &quot;Package Manager for APIs&quot;[1] came to be:\nWunderGraph is an API Developer toolkit which allows you to import and export APIs, just like npm packages.\nThis is possible because every WunderGraph project generates a static, conflict-free and versionable artifact.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t take days to add a new 3rd party API to your API layer,\nwith WunderGraph, this is possible in seconds.<p>WunderGraph lets you define your API dependencies in a declarative way.\nThe whole &quot;Graph&quot; of API dependencies is represented as an unified GraphQL Schema.\nMeta-data like API credentials, can be configured with our TypeScript SDK.\nAPI Operations are defined as regular GraphQL Operations.\nCustom middleware &#x2F; business logic can be written using TypeScript.<p>Finally, WunderGraph generates a Gateway + Client(s).\nGateway and clients communicate via JSON-RPC.\nWe call this approach &quot;Compile-time&quot; GraphQL queries.\nThe client is 100% TypeSafe.\nThe Gateway handles Authentication, Authorization, Caching, Middleware, etc...<p>WunderGraph gives you the Developer Experience of working with a single, monolithic API layer,\nalthough you&#x27;re using many different internal and external Services and Databases behind the scenes.<p>WunderGraph Supports any OpenID Connect compliant IDP for Authentication,\nS3 for file storage,\nREST (OpenAPI), GraphQL &amp; Apollo Federation for APIs\nand PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQLServer, Planetscale and MongoDB for the data-layer.<p>Today, we&#x27;re happy to announce that WunderGraph is finally Open Source!\nCheck out the Monorepo[2] on GitHub. If you like our ambitions, give us a star!\nYou can run WunderGraph locally and air-gapped, no strings attached.<p>There&#x27;s also a more extensive release post on our blog[3].\nHave a look at the examples[4], we&#x27;re keen to hear your opinion!<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.wundergraph.com&#x2F;start\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.wundergraph.com&#x2F;start</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wundergraph&#x2F;wundergraph\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wundergraph&#x2F;wundergraph</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wundergraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;wundergraph_the_next_generation_api_developer_platform_is_open_source\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wundergraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;wundergraph_the_next_generation...</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wundergraph&#x2F;wundergraph#getting-started\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wundergraph&#x2F;wundergraph#getting-started</a>",

We're Bjorn, Dustin, Stefan &amp; Jens, the founders of WunderGraph.<p>More than two years ago, Jens started WunderGraph as a Side Project.\nThe initial idea was to solve the problem of integrating multiple disparate DataSources into a single, unified API Layer.\nWhile solving this problem, Jens realized that his mental model of APIs was wrong.\nMost API tools treat APIs as abstract things or just endpoints, in a very imperative way.\nAt some point, he realized that there's a better model to think about APIs:\nAPIs are dependencies and we should treat them in a declarative way!<p>And that's how the idea of the &quot;Package Manager for APIs&quot;[1] came to be:\nWunderGraph is an API Developer toolkit which allows you to import and export APIs, just like npm packages.\nThis is possible because every WunderGraph project generates a static, conflict-free and versionable artifact.<p>It shouldn't take days to add a new 3rd party API to your API layer,\nwith WunderGraph, this is possible in seconds.<p>WunderGraph lets you define your API dependencies in a declarative way.\nThe whole &quot;Graph&quot; of API dependencies is represented as an unified GraphQL Schema.\nMeta-data like API credentials, can be configured with our TypeScript <em>SDK</em>.\nAPI Operations are defined as regular GraphQL Operations.\nCustom middleware / business logic can be written using TypeScript.<p>Finally, WunderGraph generates a Gateway + Client(s).\nGateway and clients communicate via JSON-RPC.\nWe call this approach &quot;Compile-time&quot; GraphQL queries.\nThe client is 100% TypeSafe.\nThe Gateway handles Authentication, Authorization, Caching, Middleware, etc...<p>WunderGraph gives you the Developer Experience of working with a single, monolithic API layer,\nalthough you're using many different internal and external Services and Databases behind the scenes.<p>WunderGraph Supports any OpenID Connect compliant IDP for Authentication,\nS3 for file storage,\nREST (OpenAPI), GraphQL &amp; Apollo Federation for APIs\nand PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQLServer, Planetscale and MongoDB for the data-layer.<p>Today, we're happy to announce that WunderGraph is finally Open Source!\nCheck out the Monorepo[2] on GitHub. If you like our ambitions, give us a star!\nYou can run WunderGraph locally and air-gapped, no strings attached.<p>There's also a more extensive release post on our blog[3].\nHave a look at the examples[4], we're keen to hear your opinion!<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://hub.wundergraph.com/start\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://hub.wundergraph.com/start</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://github.com/wundergraph/wundergraph\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/wundergraph/wundergraph</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https://wundergraph.com/blog/wundergraph_the_next_generation_api_developer_platform_is_open_source\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wundergraph.com/blog/wundergraph_the_next_generation...</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https://github.com/wundergraph/wundergraph#getting-started\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/wundergraph/wundergraph#getting-started</a>",

It lets you create a development environment in your cloud provider account easily.<p>You can think of it as a desktop version of Gitpod &#x2F; Coder &#x2F; GitHub Codespaces less polished and with less features but 100% free and open-source.<p>At the time of writing, it only works with Visual Studio Code and AWS.<p>In order to let you configure your development environments easily, I’ve chosen to use Docker with some Dockerfiles:<p><pre><code>  - One for your user configuration.\n   \n  - One for your project.\n</code></pre>\nThe user configuration corresponds to the tools &#x2F; settings that you use in all your projects like your timezone &#x2F; locale, your preferred shell or your dotfiles.<p>The project configuration corresponds to the tools &#x2F; settings that you use in a specific project like Go &gt;= 1.18 and Node.js &gt;= 14.<p>As you may have guessed, the project configuration inherits from the user one.<p>This project is 100% community-driven, meaning that except for bug fixes no more features will be added.<p>The only features that will be added are the ones that will be posted as an issue and that will receive a significant amount of upvotes (&gt;= 10 currently).",

We’re bringing internal tools written like CLIs to the browser to make them more powerful, through a Node.js SDK which attaches them to a hosted dashboard without any frontend code. Large companies have full teams that work on internal dashboards and tooling. Interval brings that infrastructure to anyone.<p>In our previous project we had ~65 CLI scripts for tasks like provisioning user accounts, moderating content, and migrating data. These were quick to write and powerful. They also turned into an ongoing timesuck. Non-technical coworkers needed to bother an engineer every time to run one. Some of them were powerful enough to be footguns, and because we had to rewrite validation every time, we were always a bit scared of them.<p>We wanted to bring the power and speed of cranking out CLI scripts into the world of modern software development: testable, easy to expose to colleagues via a URL, and works with Everything Else by default. That’s why we made Interval.<p>We built:<p>- A Node.js + TypeScript SDK – this embeds in your backend codebase and provides APIs for defining tools + collecting input + displaying output. These APIs are simple awaitable functions that return parsed, validated, and soundly-typed user input. You put your Interval actions in source control, test them, run CI&#x2F;etc exactly like you do for all your other backend code.<p>- A hosted UI, which handles I&#x2F;O for the scripts in a less brittle way than command line arguments do, while also taking care of auth, permissions, and audit logs.<p>This lets you take your CLI commands out of an engineer’s terminal and share them with the whole company. Give support the ability to ban spammers but not drop the prod DB. Require two people for sensitive actions. Echo commands to a Slack channel. It’s a powerful set of primitives out of the box and lets you do anything else you want in the code you’re already writing, without making you have to spin up a second company just to support your internal tools.<p>Under the hood, your CLIs and the hosted dashboard talk through a 2-way message passing system. We felt this approach was the best of both worlds:<p>- UIs are hosted by Interval: We build, host, and maintain the part most people don&#x27;t care about for internal tools.<p>- Backends are self-hosted: We can&#x27;t see your business logic, secrets, etc.<p>We&#x27;re in public beta today. I hope you like it and I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions&#x2F;feedback in the comments.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interval.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interval.com</a>",

Mintlify lets software teams easily track and manage documentation. We’re open source and our Github is at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mintlify&#x2F;mintlify\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mintlify&#x2F;mintlify</a>.<p>We worked at software companies in all stages ranging from startups to big tech, and they all had bad documentation, if it even existed at all. We decided to work on this problem and created a VS Code extension called Doc Writer which generated in-line documentation for codebases using Codex from OpenAI. Doc Writer helped people document their code more frequently and still continues to, but there were limitations. We were highly reliant on OpenAI, people didn’t want their proprietary code to be sent into the cloud, and the AI was satisfactory 80% of the time. But after digging deeper into the documentation problem space, we realized that Doc Writer only solved a small part of it.<p>We quickly learned that (1) the debate about writing documentation vs. having self-documenting code was highly controversial, and (2) entire teams hated writing documentation—not only developers.<p>We proceeded to interview dozens of startups and learned that the hardest part about documentation is maintaining it. Everybody was developing so quickly that it was difficult for documentation to stay up-to-date. Common problems we heard were that documentation was inconveniently decentralized over multiple platforms, people weren’t aware when important documents changed, and when code changes the related documentation wouldn’t be updated.<p>The goal of Mintlify is to increase visibility over documentation across your entire team so that you can easily maintain it. Mintlify allows you to centralize your documentation into one searchable place; set up integrations to receive alerts when documents change; implement a CI Check for documentation - connect documentation to code and receive alerts to update your documentation when the code changes.<p>Other solutions to the problem of documentation maintenance tend to create an editor (e.g. Notion, ReadMe, Archbee, Gitbook). We decided instead to work with teams’ existing documentation stack, because of our belief that maintenance of documentation is the real hard problem in this space. Our software is designed to help documentation owners ensure that content stays in good condition.<p>Here is our 2 min demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;892d08e178144cd89b109f9396e4db98\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;892d08e178144cd89b109f9396e4db98</a>, and you can also try it for yourself: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mintlify.com&#x2F;create\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mintlify.com&#x2F;create</a><p>Ultimately, we want to create a suite of automations that makes maintaining high quality documentation easy. We plan on adding documentation owners and integrations with task management platforms so that tickets can be instantly generated prompting people to update documentation. We believe there is a market for this because of our experience with our earlier Doc Writer product, and because companies like Glean, Gitbook, and Whatfix are all tackling this problem in their own way.<p>We thank the open source community, our community, and our users for having helped us shape the product to what it is now. We look forward to your feedback, questions, ideas, and suggestions!",

They can run on Docker containers, in development mode or production mode, you can find details in the README file.<p>After some progress on the development, I decided to pivot my experimental work to a walkthrough document. Because although there are lots of resources that exist already on the Internet, they cover small chunks of WebRTC concepts or protocols atomically. And they use the standard way of inductive method which teaches in pieces then assembles them.<p>But my style of learning leans on the deductive method instead of others, so instead of learning atomic pieces and concepts first, going linearly from beginning to the end, and learning an atomic piece on the time when learning this piece is required.<p>I know it’s in a very niche technical domain, but hope you will like my project.

The unveiling will take place at an online event entitled &quot;More Engagement, Less Code,&quot; which will be live-streamed on social media platforms on April 28.<p>According to Gartner, global demand for technology allowing hyper automation will be $596.6 billion in 2022, while low-code is expected to account for more than 65% of application development operations by 2024.<p>According to Reloadly Founder &amp; CEO Michel Francis, &quot;The new Reloadly Web Plugin removes the complexities involved to go live fast with our solutions – a task that typically requires deep engineering skills with API integrations.&quot;<p>Enhanced User Experience, Cost-Effectiveness\nIdeal for small-to-mid-sized digital businesses with limited development resources, the new Plugin lets companies send airtime, data bundles and gift cards across the globe through their websites and mobile apps. Fully integrated with both Stripe and Flutterwave, it provides wider global coverage and new payment methods, creating novel means of navigating product offerings. It also makes possible the acceptance of payments in cryptocurrency.<p>Product Manager Frankel Zambrano also comments &quot;Our Web Plugin is meant to deliver a seamless low code experience for non-engineers looking to add airtime top ups and digital gift card capabilities for their users to consume&quot;.<p>Reloadly will also unveil its new Webhook feature, in response to popular demand. Webhooks enable Reloadly to send events to an app based on processing that occurs at Reloadly's end. &quot;All performance-focused software developers should be implementing webhooks in their applications,&quot; Reloadly <em>Developer Advocate</em> Mauro Chojrin says.<p>‘More Engagement, Less Code’\nBoth products will make their debut at an event to be live-streamed on Reloadly´s social media channels. Entitled More Engagement, Less Code interactive event will showcase the products’ many benefits. Improvements to Reloadly’s demo development platform will also be discussed at the event.<p>Businesses of every size and type have come to rely on Reloadly software to transfer mobile top-ups, data bundles, bill payments and gift cards. &quot;Since launching in 2019, our mission remained the same,&quot; Francis says. &quot;To help users across the globe optimize engagement with customers with a view to enhancing business performance.&quot;",

But how can we prevent a production issue from recurring, or, how about a bigger challenge — how can you prevent the next one from the get-go?<p>In our case, we tried sending emails to our devs, writing Wikis, and hosting meetups and live sessions to educate our developers, but I felt that it just wasn’t driving the message home. How can developers be expected to remember to configure a liveness probe or to put a memory limit in place for their Kubernetes workload when there are so many things that a dev must remember? Infra just isn’t their primary focus.<p>Today, organizations want to delegate infra-as-code responsibilities to developers, but face a dilemma — even a small misconfiguration can cause major production issues. Some companies lock up infra changes and require ops teams to review all changes, which frustrates both sides. \nDevelopers want to ship features without waiting for infra. And infra teams don&#x27;t want to “babysit” developers by reviewing config files all day long, essentially acting as human debuggers for misconfigurations.<p>That’s why I teamed up with Eyar to found Datree. Our mission is to help engineering teams prevent Kubernetes misconfigurations from reaching production. We believe that providing guardrails to developers protects their infra changes and frees up DevOps teams to focus on what matters most.<p>Datree provides a CLI tool (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;datreeio&#x2F;datree\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;datreeio&#x2F;datree</a>) that runs automated policy checks against your Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts, identifies any misconfigurations within, and suggests how to fix them. The tool comes with dozens of preset, best-practice rules covering the most common mistakes that could affect your production. In addition, you can write custom rules for your policy.<p>Our built-in rules are based on hundreds of Kubernetes post-mortems to ensure the prevention of issues such as resource limits&#x2F;requests (MEM&#x2F;CPU), liveness and readiness probes, labels on resources, Kubernetes schema validation, API version deprecation, and more.<p>Datree comes with a centralized policy dashboard enabling the infra team to dynamically configure rules that run on dev computers during the development phase, as well as within the CI&#x2F;CD process. This central control point propagates policy checks automatically to all developers&#x2F;machines in your company.<p>We initially launched Datree as a general purpose policy engine (see our YC Launch <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22536228\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22536228</a>) in which you could configure all sorts of rules, but the market drove our focus toward infrastructure-as-code and, more specifically, Kubernetes, one of the most painful points of friction between developers and infrastructure teams.<p>When we adjusted to a Kubernetes-focused product, we pivoted our top-down sales-driven model to a bottom-up adoption-driven model focused on the user.<p>Our new dev tool is self-served and open-source. Hundreds of companies are using it to prevent Kubernetes misconfigurations and, in turn, are helping the tool improve by opening issues and submitting pull requests on GitHub.  Our product is well suited for self-evaluation and immediate value delivery. No demo calls — just 2 quick steps to try the product yourself!<p>TechWorld with Nana did a deep technical review of our product, which can be viewed at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hgUfH9Ab258\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hgUfH9Ab258</a>.<p>We look forward to hearing your feedback and answering any questions you may have.

This central control point propagates policy checks automatically to all developers/machines in your company.<p>We initially launched Datree as a general purpose policy engine (see our YC Launch <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22536228\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22536228</a>) in which you could configure all sorts of rules, but the market drove our focus toward infrastructure-as-code and, more specifically, Kubernetes, one of the most painful points of friction between developers and infrastructure teams.<p>When we adjusted to a Kubernetes-focused product, we pivoted our top-down sales-driven model to a bottom-up adoption-driven model focused on the user.<p>Our new <em>dev tool</em> is self-served and open-source. Hundreds of companies are using it to prevent Kubernetes misconfigurations and, in turn, are helping the tool improve by opening issues and submitting pull requests on GitHub.  Our product is well suited for self-evaluation and immediate value delivery. No demo calls — just 2 quick steps to try the product yourself!<p>TechWorld with Nana did a deep technical review of our product, which can be viewed at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgUfH9Ab258\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgUfH9Ab258</a>.<p>We look forward to hearing your feedback and answering any questions you may have.

Because of the clear syntax and semantics it is well suited as a teaching and learning language. Functions for graphic output and mouse input are built into the language.<p>The language is written in C and is open source. Main target platform is the web browser using WASM. However, it also runs natively in Windows and Linux.<p>The one-pass parser and compiler is quite fast. In the Web IDE, each time the Enter key is pressed, the program is parsed and formatted up to the current line.<p>The AST interpreter is fast, much faster than <i>CPython</i> for example.<p>The language is statically typed and has as data types numbers (floating point) and strings and resizeable arrays. Variables are not declared, the type results from the name (<i>number</i>, <i>string$</i>, <i>array[]</i>).<p>Uses: Learning language, canvas web applications, algorithms.<p>For example, I solved the <i>AdventOfCode</i> tasks with <i>easylang</i>.",

Because of the clear syntax and semantics it is well suited as a teaching and learning language. Functions for graphic output and mouse input are built into the language.<p>The language is written in C and is open source. Main target platform is the web browser using WASM. However, it also runs natively in Windows and Linux.<p>The one-pass parser and compiler is quite fast. In the Web <em>IDE</em>, each time the Enter key is pressed, the program is parsed and formatted up to the current line.<p>The AST interpreter is fast, much faster than <i>CPython</i> for example.<p>The language is statically typed and has as data types numbers (floating point) and strings and resizeable arrays. Variables are not declared, the type results from the name (<i>number</i>, <i>string$</i>, <i>array[]</i>).<p>Uses: Learning language, canvas web applications, algorithms.<p>For example, I solved the <i>AdventOfCode</i> tasks with <i>easylang</i>.",

Future: vue, native android/ios.<p>[2] Once we’re done building Bach support for all SQL platforms. Now: PG, bigquery in development. Future: redshift, clickhouse, athena, etc.",

                    "story_text": "Bike’s most original feature is the “fluid” text editing. Lots of text editors have animated some interactions (cursor movement, insert newline, etc), but I think Bike is the first designed from the ground up to support fluid editing.<p>Give it a try, it feels different. (movie on home page if you don&#x27;t have Mac)<p>Other Features:<p>• In text mode Bike works like a normal text editor. In outline mode rows are constrained to outline hierarchy.<p>• .bike file format is HTML subset, so files are easy to parse and manipulate. Bike also supports .opml and .txt.<p>• Scriptable via AppleScript. Javascript plugin API also expected in future, though no timing on that.<p>• Architecture needed to support fluid editing also makes Bike faster&#x2F;more scalable than most (all?) outliners and many text editors. I test performance using the Moby Dick Workout[^1].<p>Implementation Notes:<p>• View is built using CALayers[^2].<p>• Animations are performed by Core animation and Motion[^3] lib.<p>• View performance is determined by visible text, not document size.<p>Model representation is interesting in that it’s just a flat list of rows. Each row has a `level` property, outline structure is determined dynamically. View implementation requires that each row has a unique ID.<p>I’m using OrderedDictionary from Swift Collections[^4] to store rows. This is Bike’s performance bottleneck for large outlines. Eventually I may change to augmented b+tree and then should be able to work with gigabytes worth of outline. That will be fun, but not sure it’s actually needed. Already probably fast enough for 99% of use cases as is.<p>Hope you find Bike interesting. I’m happy to answer any questions.<p>[^1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hogbaysoftware.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;moby-dick-workout&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hogbaysoftware.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;moby-dick-workout&#x2F;</a><p>[^2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;quartzcore&#x2F;calayer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;quartzcore&#x2F;calayer</a><p>[^3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;b3ll&#x2F;Motion\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;b3ll&#x2F;Motion</a><p>[^4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apple&#x2F;swift-collections\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apple&#x2F;swift-collections</a>",

Lots of text editors have animated some interactions (cursor movement, insert newline, etc), but I think Bike is the first designed from the ground up to support fluid editing.<p>Give it a try, it feels different. (movie on home page if you don't have Mac)<p>Other Features:<p>• In text mode Bike works like a normal <em>text editor</em>. In outline mode rows are constrained to outline hierarchy.<p>• .bike file format is HTML subset, so files are easy to parse and manipulate. Bike also supports .opml and .txt.<p>• Scriptable via AppleScript. Javascript plugin API also expected in future, though no timing on that.<p>• Architecture needed to support fluid editing also makes Bike faster/more scalable than most (all?) outliners and many text editors. I test performance using the Moby Dick Workout[^1].<p>Implementation Notes:<p>• View is built using CALayers[^2].<p>• Animations are performed by Core animation and Motion[^3] lib.<p>• View performance is determined by visible text, not document size.<p>Model representation is interesting in that it’s just a flat list of rows. Each row has a `level` property, outline structure is determined dynamically. View implementation requires that each row has a unique ID.<p>I’m using OrderedDictionary from Swift Collections[^4] to store rows. This is Bike’s performance bottleneck for large outlines. Eventually I may change to augmented b+tree and then should be able to work with gigabytes worth of outline. That will be fun, but not sure it’s actually needed. Already probably fast enough for 99% of use cases as is.<p>Hope you find Bike interesting. I’m happy to answer any questions.<p>[^1]: <a href=\"https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/posts/moby-dick-workout/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/posts/moby-dick-workout/</a><p>[^2]: <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer</a><p>[^3]: <a href=\"https://github.com/b3ll/Motion\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/b3ll/Motion</a><p>[^4]: <a href=\"https://github.com/apple/swift-collections\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/apple/swift-collections</a>",

Mintlify lets software teams easily track and manage documentation. We’re open source and our Github is at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mintlify&#x2F;mintlify\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mintlify&#x2F;mintlify</a>.<p>We worked at software companies in all stages ranging from startups to big tech, and they all had bad documentation, if it even existed at all. We decided to work on this problem and created a VS Code extension called Doc Writer which generated in-line documentation for codebases using Codex from OpenAI. Doc Writer helped people document their code more frequently and still continues to, but there were limitations. We were highly reliant on OpenAI, people didn’t want their proprietary code to be sent into the cloud, and the AI was satisfactory 80% of the time. But after digging deeper into the documentation problem space, we realized that Doc Writer only solved a small part of it.<p>We quickly learned that (1) the debate about writing documentation vs. having self-documenting code was highly controversial, and (2) entire teams hated writing documentation—not only developers.<p>We proceeded to interview dozens of startups and learned that the hardest part about documentation is maintaining it. Everybody was developing so quickly that it was difficult for documentation to stay up-to-date. Common problems we heard were that documentation was inconveniently decentralized over multiple platforms, people weren’t aware when important documents changed, and when code changes the related documentation wouldn’t be updated.<p>The goal of Mintlify is to increase visibility over documentation across your entire team so that you can easily maintain it. Mintlify allows you to centralize your documentation into one searchable place; set up integrations to receive alerts when documents change; implement a CI Check for documentation - connect documentation to code and receive alerts to update your documentation when the code changes.<p>Other solutions to the problem of documentation maintenance tend to create an editor (e.g. Notion, ReadMe, Archbee, Gitbook). We decided instead to work with teams’ existing documentation stack, because of our belief that maintenance of documentation is the real hard problem in this space. Our software is designed to help documentation owners ensure that content stays in good condition.<p>Here is our 2 min demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;892d08e178144cd89b109f9396e4db98\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;892d08e178144cd89b109f9396e4db98</a>, and you can also try it for yourself: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mintlify.com&#x2F;create\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mintlify.com&#x2F;create</a><p>Ultimately, we want to create a suite of automations that makes maintaining high quality documentation easy. We plan on adding documentation owners and integrations with task management platforms so that tickets can be instantly generated prompting people to update documentation. We believe there is a market for this because of our experience with our earlier Doc Writer product, and because companies like Glean, Gitbook, and Whatfix are all tackling this problem in their own way.<p>We thank the open source community, our community, and our users for having helped us shape the product to what it is now. We look forward to your feedback, questions, ideas, and suggestions!",

Philip and Stephen here, we are the co-founders of FireJet (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firejet.io), which allows you to export from Figma to Tailwind CSS.<p>We first met at university, where we did several project together, often first designing in Figma and then developing the Frontend manually. It’s not that it was extremely hard to code out our app Frontends - however, it felt pretty dumb to be doing twice the amount of work, once while designing and then once again to implement the design in code.<p>We tried several other tools which were similar to FireJet, but the main problem we always ran into was that the other tools had alot of features like automatic semantic tagging, implementing Material UI components, and so on, but none of them got the one fundamental thing we needed it to do - which was convert it to code. Some competitors were converting certain figma frames into images, which as you can imagine is about as useful as replacing your website with an &lt;img&gt; tag<p>We made a quick prototype in a week, and people who needed the specific tailwind functionality loved it. Fast forward about 3 months, we have 700 downloads and a small (but growing!) group of dedicated users who keep coming back to us and helping us improve the product.<p>Even now, our landing page and our plugin UI are themselves developed using FireJet itself, and because we ourselves are a startup we are not too worried about coding best practices, but rather iterating and developing as fast as possible, which is why FireJet is useful for us.<p>So we are launching FireJet here in the spirit of building in public, and we hope that FireJet reduce your time to market for your startup &#x2F; agency &#x2F; company!<p>You can see a portfolio website I made using FireJet here:<p>Sample Website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philipwee.github.io&#x2F;\nGithub Repository: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PhilipWee&#x2F;philipwee.github.io\nFigma File: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.figma.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;file&#x2F;1119632484827501100",

Philip and Stephen here, we are the co-founders of FireJet (https://www.firejet.io), which allows you to export from Figma to Tailwind CSS.<p>We first met at university, where we did several project together, often first designing in Figma and then developing the Frontend manually. It’s not that it was extremely hard to code out our app Frontends - however, it felt pretty dumb to be doing twice the amount of work, once while designing and then once again to implement the design in code.<p>We tried several other tools which were similar to FireJet, but the main problem we always ran into was that the other tools had alot of features like automatic semantic tagging, implementing Material UI components, and so on, but none of them got the one fundamental thing we needed it to do - which was convert it to code. Some competitors were converting certain figma frames into images, which as you can imagine is about as useful as replacing your website with an &lt;img&gt; tag<p>We made a quick prototype in a week, and people who needed the specific tailwind functionality loved it. Fast forward about 3 months, we have 700 downloads and a small (but growing!) group of dedicated users who keep coming back to us and helping us improve the product.<p>Even now, our landing page and our <em>plugin</em> UI are themselves developed using FireJet itself, and because we ourselves are a startup we are not too worried about coding best practices, but rather iterating and developing as fast as possible, which is why FireJet is useful for us.<p>So we are launching FireJet here in the spirit of building in public, and we hope that FireJet reduce your time to market for your startup / agency / company!<p>You can see a portfolio website I made using FireJet here:<p>Sample Website: https://philipwee.github.io/\nGithub Repository: https://github.com/PhilipWee/philipwee.github.io\nFigma File: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1119632484827501100",

Karate is an open-source solution unifying API and UI test automation, including mock servers and performance testing (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;karatelabs&#x2F;karate\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;karatelabs&#x2F;karate</a>).<p>Back in 2016, I was part of the API platform team at Intuit. An issue had been slowing down the team: a particular test for a set of key services would randomly fail, and it was not clear if this was a problem with the test or if there was a genuine defect. The deeper I looked, the more the complexity around the test-suite freaked me out. It was using an in-house framework, which had evolved over years and the test depended on code in multiple files scattered across the workspace. It was clear that many programmers had attempted to fix it over the years. It was next to impossible to understand what the test was doing. There had to be a better way to express web-service functional tests, and I started thinking hard about it.<p>This gave birth to Karate, a scriptable framework combining API and UI test automation. It has seen world wide adoption as an open-source project, including 37 of the Fortune 500 companies (so far!). Companies that have written about how they use Karate include Walmart [1], Expedia [2], Adobe [3], Trivago [4], and Oktana [5].<p>Karate has its own Domain Specific Language, focused on writing tests with less code and in less time. This results in easy-to-read, maintainable tests, which are often simple enough for product owners to be able to contribute to. Karate also has powerful assertions (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;getkarate&#x2F;status&#x2F;1515657727913377798\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;getkarate&#x2F;status&#x2F;1515657727913377798</a> ), runs tests in parallel, and can reuse API tests as performance tests, which saves time compared to rewriting performance tests using a second tool. The UI automation space is crowded, but there are very few tools that do all three: API, UI and performance testing.<p>Last year, we decided to leave our day-jobs and work full-time on Karate. We incorporated Karate Labs as a for-profit company with an open-core business model in mind. In recent weeks, we&#x27;ve released our first two open-core products.<p>Karate Studio can import Postman collections, Swagger, OpenAPI, HAR and cURL. Once imported, you can preview an API sequence and edit it using an intuitive no-code interface. You can then export it as a ready-to-run Karate feature file that you can integrate into your existing CI&#x2F;CD or DevOps pipeline. If you already have a set of Postman collections, you can migrate them to Karate and get the benefits of parallel execution, powerful assertions and performance testing. If team members prefer Postman for exploratory testing, they can use Studio to convert their draft collections into full-fledged API automation suites, complete with assertions for complex business logic, and then use them in regression test suites. Studio can also export back to Postman if needed. It is available for a 7-day free trial at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.karatelabs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.karatelabs.io</a>, and you can see a demo video here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aJCgtnhektA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aJCgtnhektA</a>.<p>Our second new product is an IntelliJ plugin (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.karatelabs.io&#x2F;intellij-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.karatelabs.io&#x2F;intellij-plugin</a>) that integrates the auto-complete experience and syntax hints that developers love. Until now, Karate support in IntelliJ was via the built-in Cucumber and Gherkin support, which was very basic. Teams have wished for a better option that would take advantage of all the Karate capabilities such as embedded JSON, JS and data assertions. Now you can write, debug, and maintain Karate tests even faster than before. The plugin is available from the JetBrains Marketplace with a 30-day free trial: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plugins.jetbrains.com&#x2F;plugin&#x2F;19232-karate\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plugins.jetbrains.com&#x2F;plugin&#x2F;19232-karate</a>.<p>When it comes to &quot;build vs buy&quot;, many teams tend to build test automation frameworks. The fact that maintenance of an in-house framework eventually becomes prohibitive in terms of effort and cost, tends to be overlooked. We are trying to increase awareness that choosing a mature open-source framework like Karate is the right move for any team wanting to improve developer velocity.<p>We thank the community, developers and enterprise users of Karate for having helped us achieve broad adoption and earn credibility in the test-automation domain. We look forward to your support, feedback and suggestions.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;walmartglobaltech&#x2F;kafka-automation-using-karate-6a129cfdc210\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;walmartglobaltech&#x2F;kafka-automation-using-...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;expedia-group-tech&#x2F;karate-5-reasons-why-you-should-try-it-87539e003840\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;expedia-group-tech&#x2F;karate-5-reasons-why-y...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adapt.to&#x2F;2018&#x2F;en&#x2F;schedule&#x2F;karate-the-black-belt-of-http-api-testing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adapt.to&#x2F;2018&#x2F;en&#x2F;schedule&#x2F;karate-the-black-belt-of-h...</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.trivago.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;2019-11-14-apitestautomationusingkarate&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.trivago.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;2019-11-14-apitestautomationus...</a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oktana.com&#x2F;api-testing-using-karate-framework&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oktana.com&#x2F;api-testing-using-karate-framework&#x2F;</a>",

It&#x27;s missing a lot of stuff, is badly documented, has no facilities for accessibility, etc. So I went looking for alternatives.<p>Embedding something like QT ends up with a bunch of issues involving the threading model and so on. Others have tried and failed.<p>There&#x27;s stuff like JUCE as well but it&#x27;s not just a UI framework but a whole toolkit with its own world view and licensing etc.<p>Then I got thinking about how -- as much as I kind of hate it -- the web is really the standard for cross platform UIs. These days it&#x27;s pretty fast even on fairly low end devices. Lots of toolkit options. Canvas support. Multiple languages. Decent security model. And both Windows and Mac come with embeddable webview components (Edge and Webkit).<p>So I threw together:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rdaum&#x2F;vstwebview&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;README.md<p>Still a bit rough around the edges and somewhat untested, but would love contributions.",

It's missing a lot of stuff, is badly documented, has no facilities for accessibility, etc. So I went looking for alternatives.<p>Embedding something like QT ends up with a bunch of issues involving the threading model and so on. Others have tried and failed.<p>There's stuff like JUCE as well but it's not just a UI framework but a whole toolkit with its own world view and licensing etc.<p>Then I got thinking about how -- as much as I kind of hate it -- the web is really the standard for cross platform UIs. These days it's pretty fast even on fairly low end devices. Lots of toolkit options. Canvas support. Multiple languages. Decent security model. And both Windows and Mac come with embeddable webview components (Edge and Webkit).<p>So I threw together:<p>https://github.com/rdaum/vstwebview/blob/main/README.md<p>Still a bit rough around the edges and somewhat untested, but would love contributions.",

First project, looking back, awful code quality,  VanillaJS and really messy, it was 2015 though.

Starting to work on a desktop app. Fixing all the mistakes I made over the then 5 years of unsupervised development (starting to use version control, writing tests where applicable, learning how to structure things better so things are more decoupled, learning how to comment properly) + learning modern web tech like React and Typescript.<p>This year, I realized that the desktop app is going to take more time. I was barely getting by with the contracting, living at my parents&#x27;. (I was taking very small, unprofitable projects, to average about 20h&#x2F;week - so I could have 40h&#x2F;week for my app). Now knowing that it will take more time, I can&#x27;t follow this strategy anymore, it&#x27;s clear that I need to get a well paid full time job, work it a bit (some 2 years) and then life off the savings to prepare for the launch.<p>I&#x27;d prefer to not go for a full time PHP &#x2F; WP dev job. I&#x27;d rather aim to do work as a front-end developer or a full-stack developer, for which there&#x27;s much more job offers + the salaries are higher (money is literally time here). Obviously if it does not work out, I would take a PHP job, but it&#x27;s last resort.<p>So I was wondering, is it realistic for me to expect that I could get a remote front-end or full stack JS job in the US (I live in Europe) with my resume?<p>I can&#x27;t really say that I have been working for 2 years on a desktop app and in the next 2 years I will quit the job to launch it, but maybe I could add that I was working on a desktop app under an NDA as part of the contracting. I&#x27;m also planning a 3 - 4 month break from contracting where I could spend 700h to develop a simple web app . If time allows, I also have 2 ideas for front-end libraries I could develop or at least release a beta version of.<p>So for a summary, my resume would look like this:<p>- The 700h side project I yet have to develop<p>- 5 years contracting, WP plugin development, web app development, desktop app development (won&#x27;t hide that it was mostly WP plugin development, maybe add that I spent about 2,000h on a desktop app under an NDA)<p>- 3 years working on a SaaS app<p>So basically, do I even have a shot? Or is it not worth even trying, I should save myself time developing the side project and instead look for a lower paid WP dev job?<p>On a side note, what salaries could be expected from a remote full stack US dev job? Is 120k - 150k TC realistic?<p>Long term it does not matter that much, if the desktop app fails as a business, I will open source it and get some 5,000h worth of code published on GitHub + at least some 4 years experience working on a startup, surely enough to gain enough velocity to escape planet WP. However, getting a lower paid job means a lot more personal life sacrifices in the short term (I already sacrificed the past 2 years).",

The idea is to create a single place to explore, discover and consume public APIs as higher level building blocks.<p>Most of the time I don’t use all the features of an API and I assume most devs don&#x27;t either, so picking and choosing the common patterns, abstracting it away and surfacing a new building block is useful. For example, Twilio has a lot of APIs but I only care about SMS. Even then I just want a quick way to send it. So stripping it all away results in something that&#x27;s one endpoint and 3 fields (from, to and message).<p>Another example is something like email. There are services like sendgrid that provide a really feature rich experience for email but I’m just looking for something simple that will let me send plain text or html.<p>There are a number of API marketplaces out there, but we’re doing something different—our goal is to improve productivity. For example, RapidAPI has thousands of APIs, but there’s a lot of duplication. It’s overwhelming for developers. Choice is the enemy of productivity. AWS, on the other hand, offers a curated catalog of services where each focuses on a specific problem. We feel the same: from an API perspective you only need one of each building block. You only need one SMS, Email or Geocoding service.<p>I&#x27;ve been obsessed with this problem since working as an SRE at Google in 2011, seeing how the internal platform and APIs were being used by teams. I then worked at a ride hailing startup called Hailo where we got to build something similar, and experience the velocity of development in shipping products on top of simple, easily discovered APIs. I spent the next few years bootstrapping an open source project called Micro, trying to get people to standardize their API development to reach this goal.<p>Ultimately it took raising funding to take a real shot at it. After seeing the productivity Google unlocked and what Hailo could have done with their platform, it was clear to me it could and should be a product: a single way to consume APIs with one platform, one account and one framework.<p>Our goal is to build an API catalog that can act as the building blocks for most use cases, and then double down on services that have a lot of demand so we can improve the features and reliability.<p>In the wild, every API looks different, the docs are different, you have to figure out if there&#x27;s client libraries or not. We unify all that, so everything looks and feels the same. All our docs are generated based on OpenAPI specs, and we code generate examples&#x2F;client libraries for JS, Go, Dart and the CLI. It means you only ever need one client to access all these APIs.<p>Unifying API development and consumption requires a lot of resources to do at scale, hence it&#x27;s only happening inside fast growing startups and large tech cos. There are a lot of barriers to entry. Getting started isn&#x27;t easy. Our approach has been to first nail API development for ourselves and then focus on API consumption by end users— ultimately we want to let anyone offer APIs on our platform. That requires enough large scale distribution and inbound traffic to make an attractive proposition to developers.<p>We&#x27;ve spent a year building the product with a lot of feedback on what worked and what didn&#x27;t. We’ve signed up 8000 people, served 5M API requests and have 60+ APIs on the platform.<p>On billing: we&#x27;re still figuring it out and would like feedback. It started as a free product, then moved into per request pricing. Unfortunately that&#x27;s hard to scale without a lot of volume and it felt like people were more used to subscriptions for SaaS products so that&#x27;s the route we&#x27;ve gone.<p>Anyway that&#x27;s us, hope you try it out (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m3o.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m3o.com</a>), and would love to hear your thoughts in the comments!",

We are co-founders at Rootly (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rootly.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rootly.com&#x2F;</a>), an incident management platform built on Slack. Rootly helps automate manual admin work during incidents like the creation of Slack channels, Jira tickets, Zoom rooms &amp; more. We also help you get data on your incidents and help automate postmortem creation.<p>We met at Instacart, where I was the first SRE and JJ was on the product side owning ~20% GMV on the enterprise and last-mile delivery business. As Instacart grew from processing hundreds to millions of orders, we had to scale our infrastructure, teams, and processes to keep up with this growth. Unsurprisingly, this led to our fair share of incidents (e.g. checkout issues, site outages, etc.) and a lot of restless nights while on-call.<p>This was further compounded by COVID-19 and the first wave of lockdowns. We surged in traffic by 500% overnight as everyone turned to online grocery. This highlighted our need for a better incident management process as it stressed every element of it. Our manual ways of working in Slack, PagerDuty, Datadog, simply weren’t enough. At first, we figured this was an Instacart-specific problem but luckily realized it wasn’t.<p>A few things here. Our process lacked consistency. Depending on who was responding and their incident experience it varied greatly. Most companies after they declare an incident rely on a buried-away runbook like on Confluence&#x2F;Google Docs to try and follow a lengthy checklist of steps. This is hard to find, difficult to follow accurately, slow, and stress inducing. Especially after you’ve been woken up to a page at 3 am. We started working on how to automate this.<p>Fast forward to today, companies like Canva, Grammarly, Bolt, Faire, Productboard, OpenSea, Shell use Rootly for their incident response. We think of ourselves as part of the post-alerting workflow. Tools like PagerDuty, Datadog act like a smoke alarm to alert you to an incident, which hand off to Rootly so we can orchestrate the actual response.<p>We’ve learned a lot along the way. We realized the majority of our customers use the same 6 (Slack, PagerDuty, Jira, Zoom, Confluence, Google Docs, etc.) tools, follow roughly the same incident response process (create incident → collaborate → write postmortem), but their process varies dramatically. The challenge in changing these processes is hard.<p>Our focus in the early days was build a hyper opinionated product to help them follow what we believe are the best practices. Now our product direction is focused on configuration and flexibility, how can we plug Rootly into your already existing way of working and automate it. This has helped our larger enterprise customers be successful with their current processes being automated.<p>Our biggest competition is not PagerDuty&#x2F;Opsgenie (in fact 98% of our customers use them) or other startups. Its internal tooling companies have built out of necessity, often because tools like Rootly didn’t exist yet.

Despite searching high and low around the gazilions of &quot;flat file CMSs&quot; and &quot;Static Site Generators&quot;, I have not found a single one that remotely caters to artists&#x2F;illustrators who might want to simply post their art on an open-source, local, and truly free site with a RSS feed. No title, optional date label, nothing else around. &quot;Image-centric&quot; rather than text-centric if you will.<p>Command-line SSG&#x27;s like Jekyll are right out; I&#x27;m a professional designer, not a professional coder. I want to click two buttons to upload an image (on my site). Publii with their GUI and .deb package was much closer but bug-ridden as of now (I will retry in the future). Grav&#x27;s installation was way beyond me. etc.<p>On the flip side, if anyone wants a hobby project with tons of potential users, consider this a free idea. :)",

Despite searching high and low around the gazilions of &quot;flat file CMSs&quot; and &quot;Static Site Generators&quot;, I have not found a single one that remotely caters to artists/illustrators who might want to simply post their art on an <em>open-source</em>, local, and truly free site with a RSS feed. No title, optional date label, nothing else around. &quot;Image-centric&quot; rather than text-centric if you will.<p>Command-line SSG's like Jekyll are right out; I'm a professional designer, not a professional coder. I want to click two buttons to upload an image (on my site). Publii with their GUI and .deb package was much closer but bug-ridden as of now (I will retry in the future). Grav's installation was way beyond me. etc.<p>On the flip side, if anyone wants a hobby project with tons of potential users, consider this a free idea. :)",

Redis:\nI&#x27;ll start with Redis which I&#x27;d like to call the &quot;original&quot; key&#x2F;value store (after memcached) because it is the oldest and most widely used of all. Being a long-time follower of Redis, I do know it&#x27;s single-threaded (and uses io-threads since 6.0) and hence it achieves lesser throughput than the other stores listed above which are multi-threaded, at least to some extent. The best parts about Redis: it&#x27;s the most feature complete of all the systems here, and is the oldest. (not saying old necessarily means better).<p>2. KeyDB:\nThe second is KeyDB. IIRC, I saw it in a blog post which said that it is a &quot;multithreaded fork of Redis that is 5X faster&quot;[1]. I really liked the idea because I was previously running several instances of Redis on the same node and proxying them like a &quot;single-node cluster.&quot; Why? To increase CPU utilization. A single KeyDB instance could replace the unwanted proxying funkiness, so I ditched Redis for KeyDB. Has been a fine experience so far, except for some occasional crashes.<p>3. Dragonfly:\nJust found it on HN and seems to be relatively new. Dragonfly claims that it is 25X faster (that I couldn&#x27;t reproduce) than Redis[2] and has the slogan &quot;Probably, the fastest in-memory store in the universe!&quot;. Doesn&#x27;t support all the Redis commands yet, but I find it interesting mainly because of performance. Also, it&#x27;s good to know why it is faster because it clearly outlines the underlying architecture[2]. The other three stores don&#x27;t say much about it. Will be following the project.<p>4. Skytable:\nFound it while looking for projects written in Rust. Claims to be &quot;insanely fast.&quot; Skytable&#x27;s &quot;experimental benchmarks&quot; claim that it is something around 10X faster than Redis and some 2X-3X faster than KeyDB[3]. I hadn&#x27;t heard of Skytable and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as widely used (unless I&#x27;m missing something?). I find it interesting because of the planned features[4] and performance. Only Skytable natively runs on Windows out of the four. Will be following the project.<p>5. My thoughts:\nRedis needs no introduction and is arguably super stable for use on production systems (using widely in our systems). KeyDB seems to be &quot;stable enough&quot; and it seems to be good for prod since Snapchat uses it already[5] (and so do we!). I found no Dragonfly v&#x2F;s Skytable benchmarks.\nThe best part about Redis, KeyDB and Skytable is that they don&#x27;t make any &quot;crazy assumptions&quot; about the system they run on. What do I mean?<p>Dragonfly expects you to have the latest hardware[6] and the latest kernel[7] on all your servers. I find this outrageous because not all servers run 5.10 and a majority of them are still using long-running branches on 4.x. Also, I don&#x27;t expect them to have the latest processors, either. I&#x27;d argue if the other three stores started assuming the latest features, they&#x27;d be far faster than what they are today. Finally, both Dragonfly and Skytable are still early in their development so it may not be fair to compare their features against Redis and KeyDB who have been around for far longer. Also, all projects other than Skytable have companies behind them (unless I&#x27;m missing something).<p>Edit #1: I have run the benchmarks myself for each store. In the benchmark with Redis, KeyDB and Skytable (redis-benchmark, memtier and sky-bench): Redis and KeyDB benchmarks seem to be very consistent, Skytable is a little inconsistent at times. However, in the benchmark with Redis, KeyDB and Dragonfly (with memtier), I was NOT able to reproduce the 25X speed that Dragonfly claims. I ran all tests on two m5.4xlarge servers (one with the k&#x2F;v store and one with the benchmark tool).<p>Edit #2: Added benchmark results<p>What are your thoughts?

Mintlify lets software teams easily track and manage documentation. We’re open source and our Github is at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mintlify&#x2F;mintlify\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mintlify&#x2F;mintlify</a>.<p>We worked at software companies in all stages ranging from startups to big tech, and they all had bad documentation, if it even existed at all. We decided to work on this problem and created a VS Code extension called Doc Writer which generated in-line documentation for codebases using Codex from OpenAI. Doc Writer helped people document their code more frequently and still continues to, but there were limitations. We were highly reliant on OpenAI, people didn’t want their proprietary code to be sent into the cloud, and the AI was satisfactory 80% of the time. But after digging deeper into the documentation problem space, we realized that Doc Writer only solved a small part of it.<p>We quickly learned that (1) the debate about writing documentation vs. having self-documenting code was highly controversial, and (2) entire teams hated writing documentation—not only developers.<p>We proceeded to interview dozens of startups and learned that the hardest part about documentation is maintaining it. Everybody was developing so quickly that it was difficult for documentation to stay up-to-date. Common problems we heard were that documentation was inconveniently decentralized over multiple platforms, people weren’t aware when important documents changed, and when code changes the related documentation wouldn’t be updated.<p>The goal of Mintlify is to increase visibility over documentation across your entire team so that you can easily maintain it. Mintlify allows you to centralize your documentation into one searchable place; set up integrations to receive alerts when documents change; implement a CI Check for documentation - connect documentation to code and receive alerts to update your documentation when the code changes.<p>Other solutions to the problem of documentation maintenance tend to create an editor (e.g. Notion, ReadMe, Archbee, Gitbook). We decided instead to work with teams’ existing documentation stack, because of our belief that maintenance of documentation is the real hard problem in this space. Our software is designed to help documentation owners ensure that content stays in good condition.<p>Here is our 2 min demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;892d08e178144cd89b109f9396e4db98\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;892d08e178144cd89b109f9396e4db98</a>, and you can also try it for yourself: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mintlify.com&#x2F;create\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mintlify.com&#x2F;create</a><p>Ultimately, we want to create a suite of automations that makes maintaining high quality documentation easy. We plan on adding documentation owners and integrations with task management platforms so that tickets can be instantly generated prompting people to update documentation. We believe there is a market for this because of our experience with our earlier Doc Writer product, and because companies like Glean, Gitbook, and Whatfix are all tackling this problem in their own way.<p>We thank the open source community, our community, and our users for having helped us shape the product to what it is now. We look forward to your feedback, questions, ideas, and suggestions!",

Back in 2020, they got in a lot of hot water by suddenly announcing that user profiles -- which had been collected with assurances that the data wouldn&#x27;t be shared without consent -- would be made public, unless you opted out within a week[1]. This provoked a lot of backlash, especially since the CEO seemed totally oblivious to the privacy concerns[2]. After a lot of angry comments, he publicly apologized and reversed course[3].<p>Then in 2021, some users started once again being notified that their profiles were automatically being made public[4]. This time, it was explained away as an &quot;oversight&quot; related to the fact that previously, opt-outs weren&#x27;t permanent but had a hidden expiration time. Triplebyte once again apologized and promised that it wouldn&#x27;t happen again, and many people seemed satisfied with the &quot;transparency and candidness&quot; of their response.<p>Now it&#x27;s 2022, and yesterday I got a recruiting email from a company that found me via the Triplebyte account I created back in 2019. When I logged in to check, sure enough, my profile was set to &quot;publicly visible&quot; and &quot;open to new opportunities&quot;. I was pretty sure I had never made those changes, but just in case I was misremembering, I contacted Triplebyte support to find out what was going on. Today I got this response:<p>&quot;I was able to do some digging on to why this must have happened, It looks like before we did our last update to the platform you did not have the profile visibility set to indefinitely so the profile was turned on. Since then we have made a privacy chance once you set the profile to off there is not reset time frame it will remain off until you turn it on.&quot;<p>(Unlike the user in [4], I never got any kind of notification that this automatic change was being made.)<p>So despite their explicit promises, Triplebyte did not actually go back and fix the privacy settings for users who had them silently changed by the previous &quot;dark pattern&quot;.
